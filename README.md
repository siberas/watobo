WATOBO - THE Web Application Toolbox
===
WATABO is a security tool for testing web applications. It is intended to enable security professionals to perform efficient (semi-automated) web application security audits.

Most important features:

 * WATOBO has Session Management capabilities! You can define login scripts as well as logout signatures. So you don’t have to login manually each time you get logged out.
 * WATOB can act as a transparent proxy (requires nfqueue)
 * WATOBO can perform vulnerability checks out of the box
 * WATOBO can perform checks on functions which are protected by Anti-CSRF-/One-Time-Tokens 
 * WATOBO supports Inline De-/Encoding, so you don’t have to copy strings to a transcoder and back again. Just do it inside the request/response window with a simple mouse click. 
 * WATOBO has smart filter functions, so you can find and navigate to the most interesting parts of the application easily. 
 * WATOBO is written in (FX)Ruby and enables you to easily define your own checks
 * WATOBO runs on Windows, Linux, MacOS ... every OS supporting (FX)Ruby 
 * WATOBO is free software ( licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2) 
 * It’s by siberas ;)
